# calculator

The concept of building calculator using c programming isn't very hard. I just learned the basics which allowed me to build the calculator very easily. It was very easy to biuld using switch and function in c programming.
I used double instead of using float variable for getting more accurate and definte values, as using double gives more numbers after the decimal. Also I used switch instead of if/else for making the codes more easier to understand for myself or anyone who will be seeing the code for learning or get to an idea.
